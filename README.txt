Plugin to add some additional features to a FitNesse (http://fitnesse.org) wiki.

Wiki symbols:
- Relative dates: months or weekdays from today (extension on standard !today)
- Random values: strings, numbers, International Bank Account Numbers and Burger Service Numbers (Dutch social security numbers)
- Define default, allows a wiki variable whose value can be overridden using a system property.

Slim tables:
- table template: scenario without need to define all parameters in first line
- storyboard: script which takes a 'screenshot' after each row

Tool to determine usage of scenarios in Slim suite:
- Change test system used from 'slim' to 'slimCoverage'
- Run suite (the test will not actually call any fixtures)
- An extra result (Scenario Usage Report) is added listing the scenarios which are never used, and some statistics on those that are used.


This plugin is included in the FitNesse baseline installation of https://github.com/fhoeben/hsac-fitnesse-fixtures.
After starting that installation Wiki pages demonstrating the use of this plugin can be opened:
- HsacExamples.SymbolSamples,
- HsacExamples.SlimTests.BrowserTests.TableTemplateTest
- HsacExamples.SlimTests.BrowserTests.StoryboardTest and
- HsacExamples.SlimTests.BrowserTests.TemplateStoryboardTest).


To use this plugin in a 'plain vanilla' FitNesse installation:
- copy .jar it to $FITNESSE_HOME/plugins
